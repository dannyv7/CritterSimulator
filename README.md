# CritterSimulator
Project that seeks to emulate the behavior of multiple user created "Critters".  
Critter behavior is depenedent on each individual critter however they all share common behaviors.  
  
Critter actions include:  
1.) Consumption of Algae (which is created periodically) for energy  
2.) Movement to different locations (either running or walking - consumes different amounts of energy)  
3.) Fights with other Critters if they attempt to move into the same space  
4.) Reproduction if the Critter has enough energy units

The project backend was done in Java and the frontend/GUI was created with JavaFX
