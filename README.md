# CritterSimulator
Project that seeks to emulate the behavior of multiple user created "Critters".  
Critter behavior is depenedent on each individual critter however they all share common behaviors.  
  
Critter actions include:  
- Consumption of Algae (which is created periodically) for energy  
- Movement to different locations (either running or walking - consumes different amounts of energy)  
- Fights with other Critters if they attempt to move into the same space  
- Reproduction if the Critter has enough energy units

The project backend was done in Java and the frontend/GUI was created with JavaFX
